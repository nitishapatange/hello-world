Issues with the design:
1.	No use for blind people
2.	Disabled people cannot click the emergency button
3.	No ground floor labelling
4.	No fire extinguisher


TO GET B:

Common things that you use an elevator:
1.	Easy to go up and down
2.	Injury
3.	Heavy luggage
4.	For disabled people
The interface make doing these common things easier.

Common sequence of action:
1.	First, the user will approach the elevator and depending on the personâ€™s need will press the upward or downward button.
2.	Once the elevator arrives, the person will enter inside and would press the desired floor button.
Elevator support the user figure out how to make it work:
1.	Display helps the user to understand the exact position of the elevator.
2.	The buttons on the control panel inside the elevator for example numeric, emergency and fan help the user to figure out how to make it work.

Feedback from elevator to user:
1.	When the user press a button, the elevator will interact by emitting the light.
2.	The display unit will give the user feedback about the exact position of the elevator and also whether it is going up or down.

Improvements to make on the control interface:
